## About Me

I am a research assistant at South Dakota State University, SD, USA. The majority of my research revolves around deep neural networks, particularly for machine vision. Getting involved in research projects with different people and groups is very appealing to me. "No experience in this world has ever been cathartic without the willing participation of the individual".
